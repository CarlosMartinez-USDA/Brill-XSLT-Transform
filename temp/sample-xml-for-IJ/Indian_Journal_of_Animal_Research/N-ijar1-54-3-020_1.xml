   <abstract>Present re search was formulated to find out how honey extraction frequencies influence colony growth and honey production of European honey bee Apis mellifera colonies. Colonies were equalized in terms of food and brood before starting experiment and were subjected to three types of honey extraction frequencies namely single, two and regular/farmer's practices. Observations were recorded fortnightly throughout the honey flow season for two consecutive years (2014–16). As per present findings single extraction frequency have maximum mean honey area of 668.4 inches2 followed by twice extracted colonies (568.6) with significant difference and regular extraction (449.0) gives least honey. Honey peaks were observed during mid February (837.8–916.8 inches2) which remains significantly higher than honey areas in January and in March. As far as colony growth was concerned colonies with two extractions have high total brood areas of 436.4 inches2 and similar trend was followed in case of larvae, pupae and egg. Effect on pollen stores gave a different picture in contrast of other parameters here colonies with regular extraction were observed with significantly high pollen stores (99.3 inches2) than single extracted colonies (83.7 inches2). For high honey production single extraction was recommended and if colony multiplication was also an aim than twice extraction is best option as per findings.</abstract>
