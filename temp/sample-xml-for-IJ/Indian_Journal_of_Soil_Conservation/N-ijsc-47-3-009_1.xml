   <abstract>This study was undertaken in Andaman and Nicobar Islands by conducting primary survey of leased-in and non-leased land cultivators. Total agriculture land of the islands decreased due to massive tsunami followed by earthquake during 2004. Due to various biotic and abiotic factors, land degradation in these islands is high, and land leasing practice aggravates it. The leased rent varies from 17, 500 ha⁻¹ annum⁻¹ to 26, 500 ha⁻¹ annum⁻¹, and both cash and crop sharing mechanisms are practiced. Our analysis indicated that soils of leased land are degraded, and were categorized from moderate to severe level of degradation. The main reasons observed were that leasedin farmers mostly cultivate vegetables wherein more cultural working is required, which leads to loosening of soil and permits soil erosion at higher rate. Since, these islands receive more than 2800 mm rainfall annually with high intensity, it leads to faster erosion of soils. As the conservation measures need high investment, leased-in farmers are hesitant to invest due to short time lease of agreement (1 to 2 years). Thus, the study highlights that there should be clear cut policy for leased land to protect the limited and fragile agri-ecosystem of Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The findings will provide information for future research and policy decisions on leased land practices.</abstract>
