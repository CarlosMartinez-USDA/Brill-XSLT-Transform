<abstract><title>Abstract</title>
<p><italic>Holopothrips</italic> is a diverse group of thrips associated to galls in the Neotropics, with a variety of host plants and wide morphological diversity. Relationships to other Neotropical groups have been proposed, but are still untested, and the monophyly of the genus remains doubtful. Here, we perform a phylogenetic analysis of <italic>Holopothrips</italic>, based on morphological characters. A total of 87 species were included in the matrix and eight analyses were carried out, but all of them failed to recover <italic>Holopothrips</italic> as a monophyletic grouping. Bremer and Bootstrap support values were low, and the topologies varied among all analyses, with uncertain internal relations for the ingroup. These results indicate that the relationships for <italic>Holopothrips</italic> species, and the proposed related genera, are more complex than previously reported; and morphological characters may not be enough to recover the evolutionary story within this group. We also discuss the influences of different character coding, continuous characters and weighting schemes in our results.</p></abstract>

<sec id="s1" sec-type="heading-1"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The genus <italic>Holopothrips</italic> Hood (Phlaeothripidae) is a diverse group of thrips known only from the Americas. It has an interesting ecological standing, as the main group of thrips in the Neotropics associated with plant galls. Half of the 62 described species have been collected or recorded inside galls of a variety of plants, especially Myrtaceae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000019">Lindner et al. 2018</xref>). Most <italic>Holopothrips</italic> species collected from galls are the inducers of such plant modifications, but at least two species have been recorded invading abandoned Cecidomyiidae galls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000002">Bournier 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000037">Zamora et al. 2015</xref>), and a few others inside galls induced by other <italic>Holopothrips</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000019">Lindner et al. 2018</xref>). These thrips may also become pests of cultivated plants by altering growth and architecture, as well as tissue composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000017">Jorge et al. 2016</xref>). Serious injuries caused by <italic>Holopothrips</italic> species have been reported to cashew (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000018">Lima et al. 2017</xref>), pineapple (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000005">Costa Lima 1935</xref>) and feijoa crops in Brazil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000019">Lindner et al. 2018</xref>) and to ornamental <italic>Tabebuia</italic> trees in Central America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000004">Cabrera &#x0026; Segarra 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The genus was established by J. D. Hood in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000013">1914</xref>, based on two species collected from leaf galls in Panama. Between 1929 and 1986, 16 new species from several Neotropical countries were described in the genus, most of them by Hood in his works of 1938, 1942 and 1955. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000027">Mound &#x0026; Marullo (1996)</xref> provided a taxonomic revision of the group, describing six new species and synonymizing four genera (<italic>Anoplothrips</italic> Hood, <italic>Caraibothrips</italic> Bournier, <italic>Homorothrips</italic> Hood and <italic>Phrasterothrips</italic> Bagnall). In the following two decades, five new species were described, two from Central America and three from Southern Brazil. More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000019">Lindner et al. (2018)</xref> revisited the genus, describing 24 new species in <italic>Holopothrips</italic>, the majority from Brazil, despite the uncertainty regarding the genus monophyly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000027">Mound &#x0026; Marullo 1996</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Holopothrips</italic> is included in the subfamily Phlaeothripinae, which is itself a probable paraphyletic assemblage of species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000003">Buckman et al. 2013</xref>). <italic>Holopothrips</italic> was first considered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000013">Hood (1914)</xref>, without further comments, to be related to <italic>Gynaikothrips</italic> Zimmermann, an Oriental genus of galling thrips. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000027">Mound &#x0026; Marullo (1996)</xref> suggested that <italic>Holopothrips</italic> might be closely related to two Neotropical genera, also associated with galls: <italic>Plagiothrips</italic> Priesner and <italic>Mixothrips</italic> Stannard. A further three monotypic genera from Costa Rica were recently proposed to be related to <italic>Holopothrips</italic>: the gall-inducers <italic>Jersonithrips</italic> Retana &#x0026; Nishida and <italic>Johansenthrips</italic> Retana &#x0026; Soto (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000032">Retana-Salazar &#x0026; Nishida 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000033">Retana-Salazar &#x0026; Soto-Rodr&#x00ED;guez 2008</xref>) and <italic>Fourbethrips</italic> Soto, Nishida &#x0026; Retana, found inside galls of Cecidomyiidae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000035">Soto-Rodr&#x00ED;guez et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000025">Mound 2013</xref>). These five genera have been diagnosed on a few unusual traits not shared with <italic>Holopothrips</italic> species. However, <italic>Holopothrips</italic> itself is a genus that is morphologically diverse, and the traits used to differentiate these other genera could very well fall within the range of variation of the group.</p>
<p>The diagnosis of <italic>Holopothrips</italic> is usually made by a combination of the following morphological characters: presence of a third pair of wing-retaining setae on abdominal tergites <sc>ii</sc>&#x2013;<sc>vii</sc>; presence of anterior discal setae on metanotum; males usually with multiple and complex pore plates on abdominal sternite <sc>viii</sc>, frequently present on <sc>vi</sc>&#x2013;<sc>vii</sc> as well; and females with visible spermatheca (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000027">Mound &#x0026; Marullo 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000037">Zamora et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000019">Lindner et al. 2018</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). However, most of these characters are variable, and one or more of them may be absent in some of the species placed in the genus. Some of these characters are also not exclusive to <italic>Holopothrips</italic>: several phlaeothripid species bear anterior discal setae on metanotum, and some genera, such as <italic>Plagiothrips</italic>, also bear a third pair of wing-retaining setae in most tergites.</p>
<fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Most common diagnostic characters for the genus <italic>Holopothrips</italic>. A: presence of anterior discal setae on metanotum; B: presence of a third pair of wing-retaining setae; C: males with complex pore plates on sternite <sc>viii</sc>, sometimes on more sternites; D: females with a visible spermatheca.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1876312X_052_04_s005_text-f0001.jpg"/></fig>
<p>Due to such poorly defined diagnosis, and establishment of closely related monotypic genera without phylogenetic considerations, questions about the validity of these taxa have arisen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000025">Mound 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000019">Lindner et al. 2018</xref>). The only attempt to test these relationships through a phylogenetic framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000031">Retana-Salazar 2016</xref>) included mostly literature data of 36 <italic>Holopothrips</italic> taxa, of which 5 were undescribed species; and only <italic>Jersonithrips galligenus</italic> Retana &#x0026; Nishida and <italic>Johansenthrips galligena</italic> Retana &#x0026; Soto as outgroups. Based on the results of this analysis, the author informally proposed the redefinition of <italic>Holopothrips</italic> to exclude <italic>H. ananasi</italic> Costa Lima, <italic>H. ferrisi</italic> Moulton, <italic>H. oaxacensis</italic> Johansen and <italic>H. tillandsiae</italic> Mound &#x0026; Marullo, and revalidation of <italic>Phrasterothrips</italic> to include <italic>H. conducans</italic> (Priesner). However, the reliability of this work is uncertain, due to the low number of characters used (25 characters for 38 taxa, of which only 16 were informative), with several of them having confusing definitions or not being fully independent of each other.</p>
<p>Here, we perform an extensive phylogenetic analysis of <italic>Holopothrips</italic> using morphological data, comprising discrete and continuous characters, aiming to verify the monophyly of the genus. We also tested the proposed suprageneric relationships for <italic>Holopothrips</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000027">Mound &#x0026; Marullo 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000032">Retana-Salazar &#x0026; Nishida 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000033">Retana-Salazar &#x0026; Soto-Rodr&#x00ED;guez 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000025">Mound 2013</xref>). Due to the limited size of most morphological phylogenetic studies within Thysanoptera, we also proposed an extensive list of characters and recoded characters traditionally used in taxonomic studies. We also discuss the effects of different coding for discrete characters, addition of continuous characters, and weighting schemes on the topologies.</p>

<sec id="s3" sec-type="heading-2"><title>Taxon sampling</title>
<p>A total of 87 species were included in the analyses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). The ingroup comprised 55 <italic>Holopothrips</italic> species, which represents almost 90% of the valid species of the genus. Due to lack of information in the original descriptions and impossibility to examine specimens, <italic>H. affinis</italic> (Bagnall), <italic>H. balteatus</italic> Hood, <italic>H. elongatus</italic> Moulton, <italic>H. seini</italic> (Watson) and <italic>H. urinator</italic> De Santis were not included in the analyses. The species <italic>H. brevisetus</italic> Michel &#x0026; Etienne and <italic>H. guadeloupensis</italic> Michel &#x0026; Etienne were described after the analyses in this work were performed, thus they were not included. The outgroup comprised 31 species of 30 genera belonging to subfamily Phlaeothripinae, divided into two groups. Outgroup 1 includes the five genera proposed to be closely related to <italic>Holopothrips</italic>, with all six species described for them. Outgroup 2 includes 25 members of 25 genera with a wide variety of habits and from many regions of the world, most of which were not considered to be related to <italic>Holopothrips</italic> in previous taxonomic studies. Some species of the outgroups are also gall-inducers and could share some morphological adaptations with <italic>Holopothrips</italic>. The analysis was rooted on an unidentified species of <italic>Elaphrothrips</italic> Buffa, a genus belonging to the other subfamily within Phlaeothripidae, Idolothripinae.</p>

<p>Specimens from the following collections were studied: Australian National Insect Collection (ANIC &#x2013; Canberra, Australia), The Natural History Museum (BMNH &#x2012; London, England), Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History (NMNH), which is held at United States Department of Agriculture (USDA &#x2012; Beltsville, USA), Senckenberg Museum (SMF &#x2012; Frankfurt, Germany) and Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS &#x2012; Porto Alegre, Brazil).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4" sec-type="heading-2"><title>Morphological studies</title>
<p>Slide-mounted specimens of most included taxa were observed using an optical microscope. Most specimens were macerated with sodium hydroxide 5&#x2012;10% prior to mounting, which modifies the colours in relation to fresh specimens, and dissolves most of the internal contents. Thus, most characters included refer to external structures of the adult. Characters could be grouped into one or more of 10 major categories (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<table-wrap-group>

</table-wrap-group>
<p>The characters were defined after observations of several <italic>Holopothrips</italic> species, and from surveys of their original descriptions and some morphological studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000027">Mound &#x0026; Marullo 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000001">Bhatti 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000037">Zamora et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000006">Eow 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000019">Lindner et al. 2018</xref>). We included several morphological traits commonly used to differentiate <italic>Holopothrips</italic> species, or traditionally mentioned as diagnostic of the group; these have been coded for a phylogenetic framework for the first time here. We also propose characters that are not commonly used in <italic>Holopothrips</italic> taxonomy, such as mesonotal chaetotaxy, traits from the ventral surface of thorax, among others. Finally, some characters that are not variable within the ingroup but may be diverse in the outgroup were also included, to help structure the topology of outgroup taxa.</p>
<p>We used the same morphological terminology from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000019">Lindner et al. (2018)</xref>, in which can also be found a discussion of several of the traits used for the characters proposed here. All characters used in this analysis are listed in Supplementary File S1. Photos of studied specimens were taken using the microscope Nikon <sc>az</sc> 100M and the software <sc>nis</sc>-Elements <sc>ar</sc>, and edited using Photoshop CS5.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s5" sec-type="heading-2"><title>Character coding</title>
<p>Initially, 105 discrete characters from all body parts of adult thrips were proposed for this analysis (Matrix D1). However, some of these character states were difficult to code, and the states initially proposed were frequently equivocal. Thus, a secondary matrix with 86 discrete characters was proposed (Matrix D2), with some confusing characters removed and few others coded differently. To both matrices, 25 continuous characters were added, originating the matrices D1Con and D2Con (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). All four matrices were tested in this work.</p>
<table-wrap-group>
<table-wrap id="T3" position="float" orientation="landscape">
<graphic xlink:href="1876312X_052_04_s005_text-t0003.jpg"/>
</table-wrap>
</table-wrap-group>
<p>All discrete multistate characters were treated as unordered, and as proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000012">Goloboff et al. (2006)</xref>, all continuous characters were scaled to 1 and treated as ordered. The continuous characters involved measurements of many structures, especially of head and pronotum. The observed range for each measure was used whenever more than one specimen was available for a terminal taxon, to include the studied variation. We did not use the mean plus standard deviation of each character, as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000012">Goloboff et al. (2006)</xref>, due to having access to a limited number of specimens for most terminals. All character statements were described following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000034">Sereno (2007)</xref>. All characters, for both codifications, are listed in Supplementary File S1.</p>
<p>Non-applicable characters were coded as &#x2018;-&#x2019;, missing data was coded as &#x2018;?&#x2019;. When two or more states were observed in different specimens of a terminal taxon, the character was coded as polymorphic. We also coded a character as polymorphic in those cases where it was difficult to define between two of the possible states. This way, the analysis would consider only the two states as possible, instead of all states of the character. A discrete character matrix was built on Mesquite (v. 3.04, Maddison &#x0026; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000020">Maddison 2015</xref>), and the continuous characters were manually added to the file exported for tnt. All matrices used in this work are provided as TNT files (.tnt) in Supplementary Files S2&#x2013;S5.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s6" sec-type="heading-2"><title>Phylogenetic analysis</title>
<p>Parsimony analysis was implemented in TNT (v. 1.5, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000011">Goloboff et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000010">Goloboff &#x0026; Catalano 2016</xref>), and heuristic search strategies were conducted using the &#x2018;new technology&#x2019; option. Four matrices were built: discrete characters alone with codification 1 (Matrix D1, with 105 characters), discrete characters alone with codification 2 (Matrix D2, with 86 characters), discrete characters with codification 1 + continuous characters (Matrix D1Con, with 130 characters) and discrete characters with codification 2 + continuous characters (Matrix D2Con, with 111 characters). Each matrix was analysed with both equal weights (EW) and implied weighting (IW), totalizing eight analyses, as described on <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>.</p>
<p>The k value to be used on IW searches was defined using Mirande&#x2019;s script (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000021">Mirande 2009</xref>), for each matrix separately (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>). We used the following parameters for all searches: random seed 1, slack for sectorial searches 1000, search level 7, ten cycles of ratchet and ten cycles of tree drift with default parameters, hitting three times the shortest tree. We performed one round of TBR (tree bisection-reconnection) after each search to find if there were any more optimal trees. If there were multiple most parsimonious trees, the strict consensus of all trees was calculated.</p>

<p>Preliminary tests with a reduced number of taxa (removing up to 20 outgroups, or removing up to 16 ingroup species) were performed for some matrices, to verify the effect of sampling taxa, or if a reduced matrix would produce more consistent results. These did not differ greatly in their support values when compared to the analyses with all taxa included, thus these results were not further explored in this work.</p>
<p>The scripts used to perform these searches, and to calculate the support values described below, are given in Supplementary Files S6&#x2013;S9.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s7" sec-type="heading-2"><title>Support and sensitivity</title>
<p>Bremer (absolute and relative) and Bootstrap/Bootstrap GC supports were calculated for all analyses. For Bremer supports, scripts were created to obtain 50000 suboptimal trees with up to ten extra steps for EW searches, and 90000 suboptimal trees with up to 1.0 fit above the optimal value for IW searches (Supplementary Files S8&#x2012;S9). For bootstrapping, 1000 replications were performed using the following parameters: random seed 1, slack for sectorial searches 1000, search level 5, ten cycles of ratchet and ten cycles of tree drift with default parameters, with one round of TBR after the search. Previous tests with a minimum of two or three hits were attempted, but the resampling process became either prohibitively long, or TNT stopped working midway. Thus, we decided to not set a minimum amount of hits. All resultant trees were saved with their support values as SVG files and edited in the software Corel Draw X7.</p>
<p>To test the sensitivity of the data used, the strict consensus topologies obtained in each of the eight analyses were compared to each other through their SPR (subtree pruning and regrafting) distances. These were calculated on TNT (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">Table 5</xref>) to verify: (i) how different they are from each other and (ii) how variations in coding, addition of continuous characters and weighting influenced the results obtained. We also calculated the strict consensus and majority consensus of all topologies to observe if any clade was recovered in all or most of the analyses.</p>

<p>The analyses with only discrete data and equal weights (D1-EW and D2-EW) recovered multiple most parsimonious trees (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>), and their consensus created weakly resolved topologies (Supplementary Files S10 and S12). The inclusion of continuous characters (matrices D1Con and D2Con) and usage of implied weighting (analyses D1-IW and D2-IW) reduced the number of most parsimonious trees found, resulting in well-resolved topologies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, Supplementary Files S11, S13&#x2013;S17).</p>
<p>Comparing SPR distances between the obtained trees on each analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">Table 5</xref>), using implied weights seemed to cause less impact in the topology. The average value of SPR distance was 27 between the pairs of analyses that only varied the weighting scheme. For pairs of matrices that only changed the way discrete characters were coded, the average value of SPR distances was 32.5. Finally, the addition of continuous characters seemed to increase the differences between topologies the most, with an average value for SPR distances of 58 between pairs of analyses which varied only the inclusion or not of continuous characters.</p>
<p>Different ways of coding discrete characters affected the topologies obtained. Codification 2 slightly improved resolution, when comparing analyses D1-EW and D2-EW (Supplementary Files S10 and S12). The latter separated two clades, one comprised by most outgroups and other composed of all <italic>Holopothrips</italic> species + some outgroups, and resolved some relationships between species, which did not occur in the analysis with codification 1. Moreover, two analyses with codification 1 (D1-IW and D1Con-EW, Supplementary Files S11 and S14) generated a clade with several outgroups among <italic>Holopothrips</italic> species, which was not observed in any analyses using matrices with codification 2 (Supplementary Files S12&#x2013;S13 and S16&#x2013;S17).</p>
<p>The addition of continuous characters, combined with implied weighting, caused the most differences between topologies: D1-IW had 79 SPR steps of difference in relation to D1Con-IW, and D2-IW was 73 SPR steps different from D2Con-IW (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">Table 5</xref>). The analysis D1-IW recovered a large clade with outgroup taxa among <italic>Holopothrips</italic> species, but D1Con-IW, which differs in having continuous characters added, recovered such a clade closer to the root (Supplementary Files S11 and S15). Comparing the consensus trees of the eight analyses to each other by their SPR distances (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">Table 5</xref>), the topologies obtained by D1-EW and D2-EW had the lowest sum, which is probably due to their low resolution. After excluding the two poorly resolved topologies, D1Con-IW (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>) and D2Con-EW (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>) were the trees with the lowest sum of SPR distances, thus these two were chosen to be illustrated here. The trees obtained by the other analyses are included in Supplementary Files S10&#x2013;S17.</p>

<p>Most of the taxa proposed to be related to <italic>Holopothrips</italic> were recurrently recovered closely related or sister to a species of <italic>Holopothrips</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">Table 6</xref>): <italic>Je. galligenus</italic> was grouped as a sister taxon of <italic>Holopothrips</italic> species in all eight analyses; <italic>F. fiorella</italic> and <italic>P. eugeniae</italic> in seven analyses; and the two <italic>Mixothrips</italic> species in five analyses. <italic>Johansenthrips galligena</italic> was recovered close to the root in six analyses, indicating that this genus is most likely unrelated to <italic>Holopothrips</italic>. Species of gall-inducing thrips from Africa (<italic>Vuilletia houardi</italic>), Asia (<italic>Ayyarothrips abstrusus</italic>) and Pacific Islands (<italic>Teuchothrips flavitibia</italic>) were recovered among <italic>Holopothrips</italic> species at least in three analyses each.</p>

<p>Within <italic>Holopothrips</italic>, the position of most species in the topology varied among analyses, preventing the identification of shared derived characters.

<p>Out of these, an assemblage comprising the eight yellow-bodied <italic>Holopothrips</italic> species + <italic>H. hambletoni, H. pennatus</italic> and <italic>H. punctatus</italic> was recovered in all analyses, and formed a clade in six of them. These light-coloured species also formed a clade in most of the analyses, suggesting that a mostly yellow colour pattern for the body was a novelty with a single origin in this group.</p>
<p>A species group formed by <italic>H. atlanticus, H. magnus, H. nigrisetis</italic> and <italic>H. nigrum</italic> was recovered in seven out of eight analyses, and was monophyletic in six of them. <italic>Holopothrips reticulatus, H. signatus, H. singularis</italic> and <italic>Je. galligenus</italic> were grouped in six analyses, but they formed a clade in only two analyses, due to the frequent inclusion of <italic>H. ananasi, H. johanseni</italic> and <italic>H. pictus</italic> (all included in four analyses each), and few others. Despite being possible to observe a close relationship between these species in several analyses, the composition of such group is too variable to be safely established.</p>

<p>All <italic>Holopothrips</italic> species had at least one pair of discal setae on the anterior region of the metanotum, but these also occurred in several outgroup species. A third pair of wing-retaining setae on tergites III&#x2013;VII occurs in the majority of <italic>Holopothrips</italic> species, but was reduced or absent from some tergites in few species, and mostly absent in <italic>H. flavisetis</italic> and <italic>H. infestans</italic>. At the same time, a third pair of such setae were present in <italic>F. fiorella, Je. galligenus, Jo. galligena, P. eugeniae</italic> and in a specimen possibly belonging to <italic>Pistillothrips</italic>.</p>
<p>We proposed five characters to evaluate the presence and diversity of male pore plates (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T8">Table 8</xref>). For <italic>Holopothrips</italic> species where males could be observed, pore plates were absent only in <italic>H. graminis, H. inconspicuus, H. kaminskii, H. longisetus, H. molzi</italic> and <italic>H. tillandsiae</italic>. Few species had pore plates with a reticulate texture, which was not observed in any of the outgroups except <italic>Je. galligenus</italic>. Five states were proposed for pore plate shape on sternite VIII, of which four occurred within <italic>Holopothrips</italic>. The most common states for the genus were either one single thin and transverse plate medially, or two anterolateral plates + one transversal posterior plate (states 3 and 4 respectively, Supplementary File S1). State 3 only occurred in <italic>Holopothrips</italic> species, while state 4 occurred within <italic>Holopothrips</italic> and in <italic>Je. galligenus</italic>. Pore plates were also present in sternite VII or VI+VII in several <italic>Holopothrips</italic> species, with three of them having plates on sternites V&#x2013;VIII (<italic>H. signatus, H. singularis</italic> and <italic>H. varicolor</italic>), and only <italic>H. brevicapitatum</italic> bearing pore plates on IV&#x2013;VIII. Few <italic>Holopothrips</italic> species were unique in bearing sternal pore plates that extended towards tergite VIII. Although males of several outgroup taxa also exhibit sternal pore plates, these were always limited to sternite VIII and less variable in appearance.</p>
<p>The spermatheca was visible in all <italic>Holopothrips</italic> females observed, however its shape was highly homoplasious (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T9">Table 9</xref>). A few other taxa also exhibited a visible spermatheca: <italic>F. fiorella, Jo. galligena</italic>, the two species of <italic>Mixothrips, P. eugeniae</italic>, and the specimen identified as <italic>Pistillothrips</italic> sp. No females of <italic>Je. galligenus</italic> were available for study to verify the presence of this character.</p>

<sec id="s11" sec-type="heading-1"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>Despite highly incongruent, all analyses recovered the paraphyly of <italic>Holopothrips</italic>. In at least five topologies only few taxa were included amidst <italic>Holopothrips</italic> species, while other two analyses recovered a clade with several outgroups nested among ingroup species (analyses D1-IW and D1Con-EW; Supplementary Files S11 and S14).</p>
<p>The eight analyses performed in this work recovered divergent topologies, indicating that the data used here could not establish relationships able to resist variations on the codification or weighting schemes. Also, the support values were low for all nodes in all analyses. However, some tendencies could be observed in the relationships of some of the genera proposed to be related to <italic>Holopothrips</italic>, and even for interspecific relationships of the genus; these are explored below. We also discuss some aspects observed in the analyses themselves, such as the influence of coding, continuous characters and weighting; the occurrence of low support values; and limitations of morphology in phylogenetic studies within Thysanoptera.</p>
<sec id="s12" sec-type="heading-2"><title>Generic relationships</title>
<p><italic>Fourbethrips, Jersonithrips, Mixothrips</italic> and <italic>Plagiothrips</italic> were recovered to be sister taxa to <italic>Holopothrips</italic> species in many of the analyses performed. However, due to the topologies being highly divergent and showing low support values, any nomenclatural change seems a hasty attempt to deal with these results.</p>
<p><italic>Jersonithrips galligenus</italic> was recovered together with <italic>Holopothrips</italic> species in all analyses performed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">Table 6</xref>), being sister to <italic>H. singularis</italic> in seven analyses, and consistently related to the group of species that includes <italic>H. signatus</italic>, the type-species of the genus (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T7">Table 7</xref>). The phylogenetic analysis of <italic>Holopothrips</italic> performed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000031">Retana-Salazar (2016)</xref> included <italic>Je. galligenus</italic> as one of the outgroups, and while it was recovered in a polytomy with <italic>Jo. galligena</italic> and two <italic>Holopothrips</italic> species, the author supported its maintenance as its own genus. The pore plates on <italic>Je. galligenus</italic> are similar to the unique plates of several <italic>Holopothrips</italic> species, being organized into two anteroangular plates and one median transverse plate, with a reticulate appearance. In fact, the original description of <italic>Je. galligenus</italic> did not provide any clear feature capable to distinguish it from the typical representatives of <italic>Holopothrips</italic>, and this taxon is likely to be more related to species currently classified in <italic>Holopothrips</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>Plagiothrips eugeniae</italic> and <italic>F. fiorella</italic> were recovered among <italic>Holopothrips</italic> species in all except one analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">Table 6</xref>), but their positions in the topology were much more variable than <italic>Je. galligenus</italic>. However, the presence of a visible spermatheca in females, three pairs of wing-retaining setae on tergites II&#x2013;VII and discal setae on the anterior half of metanotum are all traits shared with <italic>Holopothrips</italic> members.</p>
<p><italic>Plagiothrips</italic> has been previously differentiated from <italic>Holopothrips</italic> due to the presence of a fore tarsal tooth, which does not occur in any species included in the latter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000027">Mound &#x0026; Marullo 1996</xref>). However, the presence and size of fore tarsal tooth is known to be variable between sexes within some Phlaeothripinae species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000027">Mound &#x0026; Marullo 1996</xref>), and its presence is variable within congeneric species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000024">Mound 2005</xref>). <italic>Fourbethrips</italic> was initially suggested to be related to some Central American fungus-feeding genera, such as <italic>Macrophthalmothrips</italic> and <italic>Sedulothrips</italic>, despite its diverging habit of breeding inside cecidomyiid galls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000035">Soto-Rodr&#x00ED;guez et al. 2012</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000025">Mound (2013)</xref> pointed out that the structure interpreted as a large tarsal tooth in the original description of <italic>Fourbethrips</italic> was actually a stout ventral hamus, and suggested that this taxon is closely related to galling thrips of the &#x2018;<italic>Holopothrips</italic> group&#x2019;. Two species of <italic>Holopothrips</italic> also have the habit of invading Cecidomyiidae galls, and an enlarged fore hamus has also been recorded in <italic>H. longihamus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000019">Lindner et al. 2018</xref>). It is possible that recurrent changes in the presence of a fore tarsal hamus and tooth occurred along the evolution of this diverse group.</p>
<p>The two <italic>Mixothrips</italic> species were also recovered among <italic>Holopothrips</italic> species in multiple analyses (five out of the eight performed; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">Table 6</xref>); however, in the other three analyses, the two species were basal to a clade including all <italic>Holopothrips</italic> species and some outgroups. While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000027">Mound &#x0026; Marullo (1996)</xref> separates <italic>Mixothrips</italic> from <italic>Holopothrips</italic> by the absence of a third pair of wing-retaining setae and the presence of an enlarged for hamus in the former, both traits have been observed in few <italic>Holopothrips</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000019">Lindner et al. 2018</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Johansenthrips galligena</italic> does not seem to be related to <italic>Holopothrips</italic> members, despite sharing many characters with the latter. Its large and bulky body, associated to the long fore tarsal tooth and unique sculpture pattern on tergites, help differentiate this genus from <italic>Holopothrips</italic>.</p>
<p>The gall-inducing <italic>Teuchothrips flavitibia, Ayyarothrips abstrusus</italic> and <italic>Vuilletia houardi</italic> were recovered among <italic>Holopothrips</italic> species in few of the analyses performed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">Table 6</xref>). However, these three do not possess most of the main diagnostic characters for <italic>Holopothrips</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>) and are known only from the Old World (<italic>A. abstrusus</italic> and <italic>V. houardi</italic>) and New Guinea (<italic>T. flavitibia</italic>). Presumably, these species being included among <italic>Holopothrips</italic> species in some analyses may be due to convergence of some characters, not an actual evolutionary relationship.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s13" sec-type="heading-2"><title><italic>The classification of</italic> Holopothrips</title>
<p>The analyses confirmed that none of the characters proposed as diagnostic for <italic>Holopothrips</italic> are both exclusive to the group and present in all members. <italic>Holopothrips</italic>, as currently defined, is an assemblage of species based on highly homoplastic characters, which seem to be easily reversible. Several characters commonly used for identification show a wide combination of states in different species of this genus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000019">Lindner et al. 2018</xref>), and attempting a classification based on a single or small set of invariable characters is not advised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000007">Gauld &#x0026; Mound 1982</xref>). Moreover, not only the current composition of the genus was recovered as a paraphyletic group, but a proposition of a new, monophyletic clade is not possible at the moment, due to the disparity among the topologies obtained here. We avoid proposing a new suite of diagnostic characters or a revision of the taxa included in &#x2018;<italic>Holopothrips</italic>&#x2019;, until a better definition of their relationships. Based on our current knowledge, species classified into different genera such as <italic>Fourbethrips, Jersonithrips, Mixothrips or Plagiothrips</italic> may be aberrant members of <italic>Holopothrips</italic>, where the typical &#x2018;diagnostic characters&#x2019; were lost or new &#x2018;apomorphies&#x2019; have appeared.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s14" sec-type="heading-2"><title>Influence of coding, continuous characters and weighting</title>
<p>In this work we tested variations on the way discrete characters were coded, the addition of continuous characters and the usage of equal weights (EW) vs. implied weighting (IW). These variations caused enough changes on the topologies, and a strict consensus for all analyses generated a tree without a clear resolution except for one pair of species. In addition, the results were influenced differently by each type of variation.</p>
<p>Character weighting clearly reduced the number of trees found, especially when comparing analyses D1-EW with D1-IW and D2-EW with D2-IW (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>), which is an expected effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000009">Goloboff 2014</xref>). Implied weighting improved the resolution, since only one most parsimonious tree was found instead of several trees with different topologies. The topological changes between weighted and unweighted analyses reflect the reduction of the influence of homoplasies in weighted analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000008">Goloboff 1993</xref>). These homoplastic characters might be partially responsible for the occurrence of a clade with most outgroups falling among <italic>Holopothrips</italic> species, as observed in D1Con-EW but not in the weighted analysis of the same matrix.</p>
<p>The addition of continuous characters greatly influenced our analysis, which is expected due to the inclusion of new data. However, the effect of adding continuous characters in phylogenetic analysis is still not fully understood. The effect of such type of data in cladistic studies is variable: while some studies report an improvement of the overall support and resolution of topologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000012">Goloboff et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000029">Pereyra &#x0026; Mound 2009</xref>), other works detected that adding continuous characters reduced the support of some groups of thrips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000030">Pereyra &#x0026; Mound 2010</xref>). The way such characters are coded (e.g. discretized, as means, ranges, ratios between measures, standard deviation from the mean) may also influence how informative they will be (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000012">Goloboff et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000036">Wiens 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>One risk when discretizing characters is grouping measures that are significantly different in the same state, or separating measures that are not statistically different (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000012">Goloboff et al. 2006</xref>). At the same time, the use of continuous characters without scaling them may give more weight to changes in these characters than to discrete ones. Measuring a single specimen or using only the means does not consider the variation observed within the species. In addition, ratios are often used as an alternative to remove the influence of body size, but they are influenced by how the two measures are compared, and may introduce bias while failing to remove the influence of body size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000023">Mongiardino Koch et al. 2015</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000012">Goloboff et al. (2006)</xref> suggest that continuous characters should be codified as ranges that span the mean &#x00B1; one standard error, to account for the 95% confidence interval of the variation observed. Scaling the continuous characters + using implied weighting would help reduce the effects of wide ranges on the phylogeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000022">Mongiardino Koch et al. 2014</xref>). In this work we treated the continuous data used with scaling and using range to include variation, plus analysed with and without implied weighting. However, the small number of specimens available for study limited the usage of mean &#x00B1; one standard error, thus our estimations of intraspecific variation might not be correct.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s15" sec-type="heading-2"><title>Low support values</title>
<p>Clades in all topologies showed very low support values, with only few pairs of species managing to be above the 50 cut for Bootstrap calculations. Such low values may be caused by the existence of several alternative topologies, with the optimal one being only barely better than the suboptimal trees.</p>
<p>Low support values scattered across branches at several points of a topology have been previously observed in some phylogenetic studies within Thysanoptera. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000030">Pereyra &#x0026; Mound (2010)</xref> obtained clades with low support values when studying the genus <italic>Desmothrips</italic> (Aeolothripidae) using a morphological approach. These authors reported that the addition of continuous characters to the dataset reduced the support, with most values of relative Bremer support being &#x003C;50 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000030">Pereyra &#x0026; Mound 2010</xref>). The molecular phylogeny of Thysanoptera recovered high Bootstrap support values for most families tested and for several species groups, but also had numerous clades with Bootstrap values &#x003C;70 at different points of the tree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000003">Buckman et al. 2013</xref>). Despite that, these studies recovered at least some clades with higher support (i.e. &#x003E;80), which indicates that there might be other factors besides the taxon studied influencing our overall low support values.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s16" sec-type="heading-2"><title>Limitations of morphology on phylogenetic studies in Thysanoptera</title>
<p>The morphological characters used in this work were not enough to resolve the relationships within <italic>Holopothrips</italic> nor its generic affinities. Our data was analysed under different codifications, combined with the usage of continuous characters and implied weighting, but none of the topologies recovered any clades with reasonable support. The information provided by morphology, as we have accessed it, seems to be limited for these thrips. Perhaps future studies will be able to evaluate the limitations of the use of morphological characters in Thysanoptera, whether discrete or continuous, for the definition of well supported groups in phylogenetic analysis.</p>
<p>The traditional taxonomy within Thysanoptera has been built largely on characters of external morphology, which remain as the main source of information for identifications and phylogenies. Most thrips are prepared for study through macerating specimens with NaOH, dehydration with ethanol, and permanent mounting on microscopic slides using Canada Balsam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000027">Mound &#x0026; Marullo 1996</xref>). Such procedure dissolves most of the internal structures of thrips, thus making DNA extraction of previously mounted specimens impossible. Most Neotropical species are known only from the type series, and the lack of fresh material also limits further molecular approaches.</p>
<p>The lack of understanding on the phenotypic variation, from intra- to interspecific, may translate into usage of taxonomic characters in Thysanoptera that do not show phylogenetic signal. Character states incorrectly delimited or wrong assumptions about primary homologies may also introduce noise to any analysis and decrease the informativeness of morphology (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000025">Mound 2013</xref>). It is possible that some traits that are traditionally considered homologous or to have the same state are, in fact, different structures or states. For example, recent observations of phlaeothripines under scanning electron microscopy revealed that the tips of major body setae usually classified as &#x2018;capitate&#x2019; or &#x2018;expanded&#x2019; can be variable in shape among species, but they lost their original form due to dehydration (pers. obs.).</p>
<p>Several morphological characters traditionally treated as discrete in taxonomic and phylogenetic studies (e.g. the development of major body setae or the distance between the maxillary stylets within the head) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000027">Mound &#x0026; Marullo 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000029">Pereyra &#x0026; Mound 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000028">Pereyra 2011</xref>) have a continuum of variation. Thus, boundaries between states in thrips studies are often arbitrary, and may not reflect actual phylogenetic signal. We suggest treating such characters as continuous in phylogenetic studies, which allow for a more accurate assessment of this information.</p>
<p>Choosing between states when the observed specimen had an intermediate state was a frequent problem as well. It was especially noticed in characters such as shape of setae apex, which could not be treated as a continuous character despite the range of variation observed. For some characters, it may be better to simplify the character states used, until the variation can be better observed and described (such as shape of setae tip and sculpture patterns).</p>
<p>Traditional morphological works in Thysanoptera frequently use ratios to describe some character states, such as head length/width, length of antenna or tube in relation to head length, or length of a body setae in relation to another structure. Such characters fail to account for variations that may occur in one or both measures which are independent from each other, as well as the influence of which measure is used as the numerator and which as the denominator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000023">Mongiardino Koch et al. 2015</xref>). The information contained on these characters is probably better accessed through direct measures of the structures of interest, which can later be treated with scaling and implied weighting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000012">Goloboff et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000022">Mongiardino Koch et al. 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>Characters related to colouration and chaetotaxy may need to be evaluated for their variation within the target group before being included in phylogenetic analyses, to verify the independency and informativeness of such variation as well as the intraspecific diversity. Despite worries about homoplasy that such polymorphisms bring into the phylogenetic studies in Thysanoptera, intraspecific diversity can also be informative, and should not be eliminated <italic>a priori</italic> from an analysis.</p>

<p><italic>Holopothrips</italic> was not recovered as a monophyletic clade in any of the analyses performed. Of the proposed related genera, <italic>Fourbethrips, Jersonithrips and Plagiothrips</italic> consistently fell within <italic>Holopothrips</italic> species, with <italic>Mixothrips</italic> also being closely related with <italic>Holopothrips</italic> species in multiple analyses. The traits usually mentioned as diagnostic features for <italic>Holopothrips</italic> are highly homoplasious, and reversals in character states possibly occurred many times along the evolution of these galling Thysanoptera. In fact, our results reveal that the origin of galling behaviour in Neotropical Phlaeothripinae was not a single event, and convergence of some morphological traits related to this way of life cannot be discarded.</p>
<p>The current work used the largest amount of morphological characters for any phylogenetic analyses within Thysanoptera to date, and one of the largest taxon sampling for evaluating a single, albeit diverse, genus. No other analyses have explored so extensively the phylogenetic signal of morphology for Thysanoptera, and the characters proposed and illustrated here will certainly be helpful for future works in this area. Despite these efforts, traditional morphology, observed through optical microscopy, seems to have reached its limits within Thysanoptera. However, morphology should not be discarded altogether; the way morphological characters are understood and interpreted is what needs improvement, and for that more morphological studies should be performed. The step forward in phylogenetic studies should be toward using additional techniques for obtaining morphological data from mounted material (e.g. confocal microscopy, morphometry), coupled with the use of data from fresh specimens (e.g. molecular, ecological).</p>
<p>The lack of phylogenetic structure in the classification of Thysanoptera is striking, with the 6200 species arrayed into almost 800 genera, of which 50% are monotypic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R000026">Mound 2014</xref>). Most of the generic classification is based on a small set of untested morphological features, and future efforts in unveiling the phylogenetic relationships within the order will change greatly thrips systematics.</p>
