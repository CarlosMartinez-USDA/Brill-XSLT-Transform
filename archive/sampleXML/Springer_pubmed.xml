      <Abstract>In this paper, functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (F-MWCNTs) were prepared
         through grafting melamine and 4, 4′-diphenylether dicarboxylic acid in proper sequence. The
         F-MWCNTs were combined with exfoliated Zn–Al layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets via
         electrostatic force to form three-dimensional (3D) hybrids. The structural characteristics
         of the 3D hybrid composites were investigated by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron
         microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA).
         It was found that F-MWCNTs were successfully combined with exfoliated LDH. TGA results
         demonstrated that the thermal stability of F-MWCNTs/exfoliated LDH nanosheets hybrids was
         decreased but the 3D hybrids produced a large amount of char.</Abstract>
