  <abstract>Two experiments were conducted to evaluate CinnaGar (Provimi; Trappes, France) and
    monensin (Ruminsen; Elanco Animal Health, Greenfield, IN) as supplements for grazing stocker
    cattle in northwest Oklahoma. In Exp. 1, twelve 2.2-ha pastures of winter wheat were grazed (1.2
    steers/ha) with stocker steers (initial BW = 250 kg) starting March 3 for 70 d. Pastures were
    fertilized in early September with 56 kg of N/ha from urea. Free-choice minerals (Beef Minerals
    3V6S; Vigortone Ag Products, Brooksville, OH) were provided to 6 pastures in ground-style
    mineral feeders, while the other pastures received a similar mineral (Beef Minerals 3V6SG,
    Vigortone Ag Products) except it contained 1,587 g/tonne of CinnaGar. In Exp. 2, 16 native
    pastures of sand sagebrush rangeland (between 4.1 and 8.2 ha each) were stocked (36
    animal-unit-d/ha) with steers (initial BW = 254 kg) starting April 24 for 84 d. A base
    free-choice mineral (Beef Mineral 3V6S) was used and monensin and CinnaGar were added in a 2 x 2
    factorial arrangement of treatments; 1) 0 and 0; 2) 1,761 and 0; 3) 0 and 2,351; and 4) 1,761
    and 2,351 g/tonne of monensin and CinnaGar, respectively. In Exp. 1, mineral intake was 150 and
    107 g/d for no CinnaGar and CinnaGar (P = 0.24), respectively. Also, ADG (overall avg = 1.4 kg)
    did differ (P = 0.66) between no CinnGar and CinnaGar; hence, ending BW (overall avg = 339 kg)
    or BW gain/ha (overall avg = 44 kg) did not differ (P &gt; 0.52). In Exp. 2, mineral intake
    differed (P &lt; 0.01) by treatment and was 79, 31, 68, and 43 g/d, respectively; the addition
    of monensin decreased mineral intake (P &lt; 0.01), while CinnaGar did not affect mineral intake
    (P = 0.80). Further, ADG (overall avg = 0.65 kg) did not differ (P = 0.47) among treatments;
    hence, ending BW (overall avg = 305 kg) or BW gain/ha (overall avg = 41 kg) did not differ (P
    &gt; 0.48). At these levels of CinnaGar intake and with these types of pasture, these
    supplements did not significantly affect animal performance. </abstract>
